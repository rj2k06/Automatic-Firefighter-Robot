# Automatic-Firefighter-Robot
This project involves the development of an autonomous firefighting robot powered by an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The robot is designed to detect and extinguish small-scale fires in controlled environments, making it a useful tool for demonstration, educational purposes, and basic safety automation.
The robot integrates six different sensors that work in unison to continuously monitor the surroundings. These include a combination of temperature sensors, flame sensors, and infrared (IR) sensors, which collectively help in accurately identifying the origin and current position of a fire within its operational range.
Upon detecting the presence of a fire, the sensor data is processed by the Arduino Uno, which then calculates the optimal path to the fire source. The robotâ€™s motor driver module receives directional commands to navigate towards the fire. The movement is precisely controlled to ensure that the robot maintains a safe and effective distance from the fire, avoiding any potential damage to its electronic components.
Once in position, the robot activates its onboard water pump mechanism, which begins to spray water toward the fire source. The spraying continues in a controlled manner until the sensors detect that the fire has been fully extinguished.
##The key features of this project include:
###-Real-time fire detection using multi-sensor input
###-Autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance
###-Precision-controlled actuation using motor drivers
###-Automatic fire suppression via water pump control
###-Reliable processing and decision-making using the Arduino Uno platform
This project demonstrates a practical implementation of embedded systems and robotics in firefighting applications and showcases how microcontroller-based solutions can contribute to safety and automation in dynamic environments.
